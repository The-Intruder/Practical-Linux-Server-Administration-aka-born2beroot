## What the f\*\*\* does this mean ?

### Community enterprise Linux Operating System _or simply_ CentOS

**CentOS** is an open-source Linux  _(meaning that it uses the Linux kernel)_, _Duh!_. It was developped by _Red Hat_ _(the company behind the famous Red Hat Entreprise Linux, and the main contributor to several open-source projects)_, and maintained by —also— _Red Hat_ along with the open-source community.

Its main use is to test features that will be integrated in future _Red Hat Entreprise Linux_ releases, and it can also be used as an OS just like any other OS for personnal uses _(probably not for typical desktop users, sorry, but it's just the truth)_ and professional uses as well _(as a server maybe)_. I mean after all it's open-source, right ?!??

### Debian GNU/Linux

_Debian_ is one of the oldest Linux distros _(distributions)_, that are still used and maintained until this day

The name is somewhat a combination between:
1. The name of the _Debian_ founder: _**Ian** Murdock_ 
2. And his —then— girlfriend: _**Deb**ra Lynn_
Which gives us _**Deb**~~ra~~**Ian**_

_Debian_ has several branches, the most notable one being the _Debian stable_ which is a very popular choice when it comes to _Personnal Computers_ as well as _Servers_.

It is maintained by the open-source community, specifically by a team of volunteers from all around the world, whom are guided by the _Debian Project Leader_ and three foundational documents: the _Debian Social Contract_, the _Debian Constitution_, and the _Debian Free Software Guidelines_.
